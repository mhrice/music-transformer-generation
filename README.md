# music-transformer-generation
## About
Transformer-based symbolic music generation based on [Music Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281) using [REMI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00212) midi encoding.

Uses [MidiTok](https://github.com/Natooz/MidiTok) for the encoding and model implementation from [here](https://github.com/gwinndr/MusicTransformer-Pytorch).

Dataset used: [Lakh MIDI Dataset](https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/).
